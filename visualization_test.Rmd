## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
network_df <- final2 %>%
  select(people, role, title)
```

```{r}
people_igraph <- graph_from_data_frame(network_df, 
                                       directed = FALSE)

people_network <- ggnetwork(people_igraph)

ggplot(data = people_network, aes(x = x, y = y, 
                                     xend = xend, yend = yend)) +
  geom_edges(color = "lightgrey") +
  geom_nodes() +
  geom_nodelabel(aes(label = name)) +
  theme_blank()
```
